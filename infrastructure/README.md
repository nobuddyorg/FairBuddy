# Infrastructure

This project uses **Pulumi** for Infrastructure as Code to provision, manage, and maintain cloud resources programmatically. It includes four convenience scripts:

**/scripts/pulumi-init-backend.sh** initializes the Pulumi backend for state management
**/scripts/pulumi-deploy.sh** deploys the defined infrastructure to the target environment
**/scripts/pulumi-destroy.sh** tears down and cleans up the deployed resources
**/scripts/pulumi-outputs.sh** displays outputs and relevant information from the deployed stack

This setup simplifies cloud infrastructure management by automating deployment, updates, and teardown.

## About Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is an approach to designing and managing infrastructure using code and software development practices instead of manual configurations. With IaC, infrastructure becomes versionable, repeatable, and testable, which improves consistency, reduces human error, and enables automation in deployment workflows. IaC is a fundamental part of DevOps practices and supports CI/CD pipelines, testing, reusable components, and auditability. Learn more about the concept here:

## About Pulumi

**Pulumi** is a modern open‑source Infrastructure as Code platform that lets you define, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure using familiar general‑purpose programming languages such as TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, Java, and YAML. Unlike some tools that require a specialized domain‑specific language, Pulumi allows you to use real languages with full IDE support, testing, abstractions, and reusable components. Pulumi works across many cloud providers including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and over 120+ others. Learn more in the official docs:
